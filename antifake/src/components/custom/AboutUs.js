                Product faking is something which is very common now-a-days and it's almost impossible
                to detect a counterfeit product just by looking at it. Fake products cause significant
                challenges for legitimate firms, yet far too many people have no idea of the entire amount
                of counterfeit items' influence on brands. There are several methods devised in the past to
                get away with this problem of fake products. In recent years, Blockchain has received
                increasing attention and numerous applications have emerged from this technology. Any
                application using Blockchain technology as the base architecture ensures that the contents
                of its data are tamper-proof. This paper uses the decentralized Blockchain technology
                approach to ensure that consumers do not fully rely on the merchants to determine if
                products are genuine. This project describes a decentralized Blockchain system with
                products anti-fake, in that way manufacturers can use this system to provide genuine
                products without having to manage direct-operated stores, which can significantly reduce
                the cost of product quality assurance.!
